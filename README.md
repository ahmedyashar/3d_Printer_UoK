## 2. Aim 

1. The aim of this project is to build a prototype of a House 3D printer.

2. The dimensions or work space is limited to 2m by 2m (small room).

3. A model platform to conduct numerus research in improving the print quality such as 

   ​	a. Mechanical control and vibration.
   ​	b. Material properties of wall strength and heat transfer.
   ​	c. fusibility Complex architect.  

## 3. Objectives 

1. Implementing 3D Printing technology in small scale construction machine. 
2. The main plane is to study the suitable type of mechanism such as Cartesian, cylindrical or SCARA. 
3. Study different material and list the properties of each type. 
4. Build an extruder according to the selected construction material. 
5. regarding the extruder size and weight the 3D Printer links will be design.  

## 4. Parts and Materials 

### `Mechanical Parts`

1. #### Extruder 

2. #### Arms and Slides 

3. #### Power Transmissions (Gear and Belts) 

4. #### Foundation 

### `Electrical Parts`

1. #### Stepper motors 

2. #### Stepper motor drivers 

3. #### controller board 

4. #### Power Supplies 

### `Construction Materials` 

### `software` 

1. #### cad (AutoCAD and SolidWorks)

2. #### cam (slicer) 

3. #### G-Code sender

#### 5. Basic Concepts in selecting printer type.

The main criteria in selecting the type of 3D Printer are:

1.  axis coordinates
2. size 
3. .......
4. .......

Regarding to axis coordinates, In general the printers can be divided into  main four  types  as show in figure below.

heavy constructions such as building  required a fixed base. This means the nozzle of the printer will movies in three dimensions while the platform is fixed. furthermore, the printer can be disassemble after building the printed model. The most matching printer types can be Cartesian , Delta and SCARA. due to the fixed platform. 

 According to the size
